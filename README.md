# Art_Gallery

HTML, CSS, and Javascript have been used to develop this project.

This project was developped to ensure a better understanding of responsive features.

Javascript was also used to create some dragging and effect on the pictures of the main page.

The rest of the zooming and hover effect were created using css only.
